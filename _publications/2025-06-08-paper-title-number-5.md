Using India’s **public expenditure data**, various time-series techniques were applied—such as regression analysis, unit root tests, cointegration techniques, and a vector error correction model.  

**Key result:**  
The study shows a **positive elasticity** of growth rate in public expenditure to the first difference of per-capita GDP, with modifications to the theoretical model proposed by earlier researchers.

This was completed as part of a **Public Finance course project** at **JNU, Delhi** during *Fall 2020*.
