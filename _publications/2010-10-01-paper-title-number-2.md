This study investigates **anthropometric measurements** (height, weight, BMI, and related indicators) of children across **nuclear** and **joint families**, exploring the influence of family structure on child growth outcomes.  
Key findings include:
- Significant differences in growth indicators between nuclear and joint family settings  
- Socio‑economic factors contributing to observed variations  
- Policy implications for child health and family welfare programs
