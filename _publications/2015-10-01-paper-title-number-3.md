This paper analyzes an **entry deterrence model** between an incumbent and a potential entrant, where the incumbent strategically offers bribes to local officials to raise entry barriers.  
Key contributions include:
- A three‑stage **Bertrand** game under incomplete information in a differentiated goods market.  
- Comparison of optimal bribes between **Bertrand** and **Cournot** competition.  
- Findings that the optimal bribe **decreases sharply under Bertrand competition** as product substitutability increases, while remaining lower than in Cournot competition.  
- Establishment of a **zero net cross‑effects property**, showing price responsiveness to market size and marginal cost vary with competition intensity but offset each other.  

These results inform policymakers on how competition type and product nature affect entry deterrence strategies, aiding in the design of effective regulations and anti‑corruption policies that promote fair market entry.
