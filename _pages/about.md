I am **Vishavdeep Sharma**, a Ph.D. Candidate in Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics (AEDE) at **The Ohio State University**, specializing in Industrial Organization, and Applied Econometrics.  

My research explores how market structures, government policies, and strategic firm behavior interact to shape outcomes in emerging and developed economies. I am particularly interested in topics such as entry deterrence, market quality, and the role of regulatory frameworks in influencing competition and efficiency.

Alongside my research, I have a strong passion for teaching. I have served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for courses in Statistics, Econometrics, and Agricultural Finance, where I design and deliver lectures, lead lab sessions in R, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Prior to my doctoral studies, I taught at several colleges under the University of Delhi, gaining extensive experience in core economics subjects.

Beyond academics, I enjoy sharing knowledge through outreach reports, presentations, and mentoring students. My long-term goal is to contribute impactful research and teaching that bridge academic insights with real-world applications.
